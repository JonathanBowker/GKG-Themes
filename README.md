GKG-Themes
==========

The keywords used to generate themes for the GDELT Global Knowledge Graph. http://gdelt.utdallas.edu/

I'm experimenting with open source updating of the list with version control.

Fork and pull request any changes to the main document. Add new keywords for a new theme by testing the terms in Google News, sorting by recency, not relevance. Excluded terms can be added with negative scores. Plurals/alternative spellings need to be added separately. Put any wishlist themes in the issues tracker, but it's better if you find the terms yourself.
